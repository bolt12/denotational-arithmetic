## Arithmetic via denotational design

This repository is an experiment in collaborative denotational design.

The Agda standard library defines arithmetic for `ℕ` in `Data.Nat`, particularly `0`, `1`, `_+_`, and `_*_`.
The puzzle to be addressed in this project is elegant specification and correct calculation of these same operations on bit vectors.
The specifications should be homomorphic, centered on a denotation `⟦_⟧ : Vec Bool n → ℕ`.

I've enabled the GitHub [discussions](https://github.com/conal/denotational-arithmetic/discussions) feature for this repo.
